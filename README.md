## Creation Process

### **1. Strategy**

- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about menu options and opening times.
- Location of the clinic must be visible and social media links available.
- clean and simple design and use of graphics and colour to motivate the user.
- Pricing within the pricelist page is to be transparent and simple.
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.

### **2. Scope**

A large portion of their clients are young women age 20 to 40 who are looking for the best treatments and they want to prevent of any kind of damage and wrinkle to their skin, and they want to spend an hour calmly in a quite place, feeling relax.

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, location, and opening times.
-
- For future development, the testimonials page has focused on before and after the treatment so clients can introduce lunaria to their friends.

### **3. Structural**

- Similar to the idea for the design and layout to be accessible and functional, simple navigation were essential. The site needed to provide information to encourage young women to take care of their skin.
- Easy to identify, clickable links with a consistent layout. The design was to be predictable for each page with the information clearly identifiable.
- A large, clear button to bring the user directly to the menu would be placed front and center of their eye-line.
- In addition, a navigation bar and footer would be visible,where navigation bar sticked at the top of the page when you scrooled down in every page, at every device size, displaying the same information. This would provide the returning customer with a faster route to their information destination.

### **4. Skeleton**

The site was developed to be simple, clear, and relax.

- For the landing page, the logo, lunaria beauty, was to be at the center of every page, no matter the orientation or screen size.
- The simple, four-item navigation bar of 'Home', 'price list', testimonials and 'Contact', is situated always to the middle of the page and undeneath the logo. An underline feature identifying the current page and also a hover on the menu.
- A large, clear image dominates the landing page with a close-up view of a woman feeling fresh and fabolouse.
- right side of the image, clickable button situated on the image which takes you to the contact page and testimonials page. First-time visitors have access to the menu with one easy click.

- The page ends with the footer, where the social media has placed.

- For the price list page, the navigation bar and footer remain as before. included all the treatments and the time of the treatments, offers and all the prices with very good size of image which has describe almost all the treatments.
- For the contact us page, the navigation and footer remain as before. big size of eucalyptus leaf behine the form is intoducing the freshnes of the clinic to the client. An optional form for visitors who wish to connect with the business with an interactive Google Map with the business location pinned. There is an option to enlarge the map in a new window and find directions.

### **5. Surface**

-
- A design was created that allowed a consistent flow throughout the four-page site.

- A palette of gray and green was created, similar to the interior of the parlour.
- A clean, playfair, was used in a medium weight to provide legible text at any size.
- back to top buttons has settled in all the pages to make it easy for the visitors when the y scroll down.

## Design

### **Color Scheme**

This website used a fresh, bold palette of grey and greenish warm color to capture the aesthetic of a beauty. The colours reminded me of feeling fresh and relax. I combined these with an off-white shade for the field of the form.

### **Typography**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'playfair' and 'Lato'. I felt the clear, soft lettering suited the intended aesthetic of the website. I had intentions to use Lato for my smaller bodies of text, however, I chose to stick with playfair to keep the font consistent.

![google Fonts playfair](/docs/fonts%20-%20Edited.png)

### **Imagery**

The images that I have chosen for my site reflect the freshness. A large image sits below the menu options, it shows the freshness and looking good and taking car of your skin. The sites [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [canva.com](https://canva.com/) provided the royalty-free stock images used throughout the website, with attributions to each photographer placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

## Testing

### **Initial testing plan**

I had planned for this site to be accessible and legible on all screen sizes. The user is viewing the site primarily for the menu options and parlour location and they needed to access this information with one click. I used Chrome Dev Tools to test, tweak and debug in the early stages. I deployed my site halfway through to test on real-world devices. These devices included:

- Acer Aspire 3 Laptop (1920 X 1080)

- iPad Pro 2021
- iPhone SE(2016)
- Huawei p30 Lite
- iPhone 11/13
- Samsung Galaxy s10

### **Bugs & Fixes**  
  
| Bug | Section | Fix |
| :----| :----| :--------:|
| Whitespace added to right-hand side of webpages | All pages | Using Dev Tools, I added a thin red border to every element in my website. From this, I discovered that I had mistyped a value in my footer padding section and made it too large. This was pushing the footer element outside of the webpage width. I adjusted the padding to the correct value and the issue was resolved. |
| Nesting button element & anchor element | Index/Home page | When running an early W3C validation test, I discovered that I had made an error by placing a button element inside an anchor element within my tagline section. Semantically, this was incorrect. I considered using a span element instead and upon consulting Stackoverflow and this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6393827/can-i-nest-a-button-element-inside-an-a-using-html5) I confirmed my understanding. I re-checked my HTML code with W3C Validator and my live site to find the issue resolved. |
| Flexbox issues with positioning business ethos section - elements bunched together | Index/Home page | As I was learning flexbox whilst completing the project, I had not yet fully understood the div parent/child relationship. I consulted the Mozilla Developer Docs for Flexbox and discovered that I was not using enough divs for the elements to display correctly. I placed each of my headings, paragraphs, and images within divs and applied flexbox properties to their parent divs and themselves. Assigning flex-direction: row and justify-content: space-around/space-between solved my issue, with each of the elements positioning themselves with appropriate spacing between. I then applied this structure to the remaining two ethos items. |
| br element in li element  | Menu Page |  Semantically I made an error by using the br element to make space between my menu items. On performing the W3C validation test, I became aware of this error. I considered using margin-top to fix the issue. I Googled the issue to understand my error further and came across a Stackoverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66564503/wrong-validation-on-element-br-in-ul-li-elements), with a comment from Quentin detailing how to use margin-top avoiding the first child element of the parent div. I used this piece of code in my CSS file to control the spacing between the menu items after understanding the code fully. |
| Viewport meta tag  | Head section/All pages | On first deploying my website to real devices, the mobile pages were appearing zoomed in upon loading. They appeared normally on Dev Tools mobile testing sizes. I checked my CSS code and my viewport meta tag for any obvious errors. Upon finding none I consulted Stackoverflow to find this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14272420/webpage-starts-zoomed-in-on-mobile-devices). I removed the initial-scale=1.0 from the viewport meta tag, leaving only width=device-width, I ran the code through the W3C Validator to find no errors. This fixed the issue on all real-world mobile and tablet devices |
| Index page styling disappeared | Index/Home page | Due to commenting out the wrong section of CSS code, I had caused styling on my home page to disappear. Checking the code, I spotted the error and rectified it. |
| Textarea misalignment | Contact page | Due to a developer mistype, I had altered my CSS code for my contact form textarea. I re-added display:block and margin:auto to center the element again. |

### **Unsolved Bugs**

- On viewing my deployed site on Safari browser, I found the Josefin Sans font to be displayed differently in the header elements. The website is still displayed adequately despite this issue. I will continue my learning to understand how to combat small, browser display differences to discover if I can overcome this.

- On occasion, when viewing my website in Dev Tools, a small amount of whitespace appears to the right of the Home page. When I refresh the page or clear the cache, this issue resolves itself. I have not figured out yet why this happens on rare occasion.

- Even though my site is responsive on Dev Tools and on real world devices, it does not work on multiple-media, screenshot generating websites like 'ui.dev/amiresponsive'. It appears zoomed in, similar to the viewport meta tag issue as documented above. I have yet to figure out why this is the case.
